## DAYZ DEBUG MODE!
This is a simple DEBUG mode based on the Documentation provided by boheima on how to setup a server locally. 
The idea of DEBUG MODE is to have sepreate multilple servers files in a clean workflow from in a sigular loction.

### NOTE: This is NOT Offline Mode.
This replicates the way your server will run nativiely but on your local machine.  
There are no built in admin tools or extra feature. It is strcitly vanillia dayz until you add your mods to the !debug_mode.Bat

## Folder Structure

### DZNC_Icons  
( A group of optional icons you can use to make the links to your .bat files look a little nicer)

### expmissions
(This is a folder that will contain all the server files for Experimental Servers)

### mpmissions
(This is a folder that will contain all the server files for Vanillia Servers)

## DayZ Loot Editor 
I have included a current copy of the DayZ Loot Editor in the Repo.  This file needs to be exctrated to your missions folder tht contains all your xml.
